# bi-objective-green-scheduling
Researches and Metaheuristics to solve the Bi-Objective Green Scheduling problem.

# Benchmark Instances

All instances used here are from the 2021's paper about this bi-objective problem:
https://github.com/ORresearcher/A-bi-objective-heuristic-approach-for-green-identical-parallel-machine-scheduling

Accordingly to authors, the above instances were subdivided in three groups:

90 in total (30 small-scale, 30 medium-large, 30 very-large).
3 files for each instance j = 1,...,90:

    Data_cj.txt : time slots energy prices
    Data_pj.txt : jobs processing times
    Data_ej.txt : machines (unitary) energy price
