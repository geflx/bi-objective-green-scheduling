# Bi-objective green scheduling problem :earth_americas::chart_with_upwards_trend:
Researches and Metaheuristics to solve the Bi-Objective Green Scheduling problem. The problem consists of scheduling _N_ jobs in _M_ machines in such a way to reduce makespan and total energy consumption.

# How to compile and run :computer:

In the "Code" folder, make sure makefile is installed in your machine and type the following commands on terminal:

```
makefile && ./a.out
```

# Instances :paperclip:

All instances used here are from the [2021's paper about this bi-objective problem.](https://github.com/ORresearcher/A-bi-objective-heuristic-approach-for-green-identical-parallel-machine-scheduling)

Accordingly to authors, the 90 instances were subdivided in three groups: small, medium-large and large instances.
